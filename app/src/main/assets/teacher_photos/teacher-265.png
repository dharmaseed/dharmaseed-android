She has dual\r\nroots in the Buddhist and Quaker traditions. Barbara teaches insight or\r\nvipassana meditation and practices to people of all faiths, traveling\r\nthroughout the world. She is an ordained Interfaith Minister. In Ann Arbor,\r\nMichigan, in 1989, Barbara founded Deep Spring Center and has been the\r\nguiding teacher of this organization. \r\n\r\nBarbara has been profoundly deaf over thirty years; living with silence has\r\ngreatly influenced her life and teaching. She is married and the mother of\r\nthree adult children. She is also the channel for the discarnate entity,\r\nAaron, who in many previous lifetimes, has been a practitioner of many \r\nreligions, including lifetimes spent as a Buddhist monk and scholar. In his \r\nfinal lifetime he was a Vipassana meditation master in the Theravadin tradition. \r\nWhile the presence of a discarnate teacher may raise questions for some, \r\nBarabara asks you only to approach Aaron\u2019s teaching with an open mind \r\nand see if it speaks to your heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "monastic": false, "donation_url": "", "no_sales": false, "public": false, "status_notes": "", "teacher_audio_message": "", "audio_presentation_chance": 50, "is_active": true, "_Teacher__original_public": false, "_Teacher__original_is_active": true, "non_public": true, "_REST_note": "If photo member is non-empty, use it to fetch the teacher photo.\n        Extension may be changed to e.g. photo.jpg or photo.gif for alternate formats.\n        URL parameters maxH and maxW may be used to specify the dimensions to scale it to."}
