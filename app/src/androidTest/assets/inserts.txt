INSERT INTO "teachers" VALUES(96,'http://www.dharma.org/joseph-goldstein','I have two main aims in teaching. The first is to spread the dharma as widely as possible, offering it to as many different people as I can.  The second is to teach a smaller number of people over sustained periods of time. This in-depth teaching engages my tremendous love for intensive, long-term meditation practice, where people can immerse themselves in the retreat experience and see how it transforms their understanding.


Although deeply rooted in the Vipassana tradition of Theravada Buddhism, I enjoy working with various skillful means from different Buddhist schools to help convey the essence of all practice, the one dharma of liberation.  This essential dharma includes the wisdom of non-clinging, the motivation of compassion to practice for the benefit of all beings, and the potential for  liberation within us all.

Given the speed and complexity of our culture, the Buddha''s teachings offer a much-needed means to slow down, a way to create some inner calm.  We need to touch base with this place of tranquillity in order to allow our bodies and minds to unwind.  We then have the chance to see more deeply and profoundly the nature of our lives, how we create suffering and how we can be free.  The dharma begins with the development of calm and it carries us all the way to liberation.

INSERT INTO "teachers" VALUES(79,'','What has always engaged me is working with practitioners who are deepening their commitment to the Dharma and then seeing them take a quantum leap in their understanding.  My contribution to this commitment is working towards conveying a Theravadan practice with a Mahayana spirit.

The Theravadan practice of vipassana provides simple, direct instructions that can be immediately understood and applied in daily life as well as retreat practice.  The Mahayana spirit has the beautiful attitude that we practice not for ourselves alone, but for all sentient beings.  Between the two, the unfolding of liberation for ourselves and others becomes a simple, down-to-earth practice that anyone can do.

It is fun for me to take the most difficult concepts and put them into accessible language, to unwrap the mystery.  So I try to find ways to explore the breadth of concepts like "emptiness" -- to see how the entire path can be explained in terms of this synonym for nibbana.  One of my aims is to bring the goal of freedom into the here and now.  This way practitioners get a taste of freedom, so they know what they are heading toward on their journey to liberation.

The tools of mindfulness and lovingkindness can be picked up by anyone.  They are easy to understand and they bring immediate benefit to our lives.  The essence of vipassana is ideally suited to western society, especially to the resonance between our psychological turn of mind and our quest for spiritual understanding.

INSERT INTO "teachers" VALUES(4,'http://www.amaravati.org/','I think of myself primarily as a monk who occasionally teaches, who strives to convey the spirit and the letter of Buddhism through my lifestyle, through explanation, and through the imagery of storytelling in order to bring Buddhism to life for people who are seeking truth and freedom.

As co-abbot of Abhayagiri Monastery, I am deeply involved with forming a monastic community that can serve as a guiding spirit for Buddhist practice in the world.   The traditional, renunciate form of the practice is the embodiment of simplicity, strength and resiliency for anyone who seeks classical training in the monastic life.  It is also a hand extended to the lay community that says: come, experience the life of the forest, the chanting, the bowing, the serenity of meditation, the robes, the peacefulness of celibacy.  Draw from our well and bring this spiritual nourishment back into your everyday life.

The outward structure of traditional Buddhism supports a form of spiritual living that is grounded in honesty, non-violence, and living in truth-all the qualities of inner freedom that are precious to me.  Buddhist practice turns the current of attention toward an inner life, irrigating the arid internal landscapes created by the external priorities of our Western world.

Buddhist practice also reconstructs our relationship to time and space.  Our fragmented world is suffering from a continually diminishing attention span as we become overwhelmed with so much to do, with so little time and so many options.  The practice allows us to visit our interior landscape, slow down, pay attention to the qualities of time and spirit, to explore who we are, instead of focusing on what we do.  Buddhism trains the heart to recognize happiness, not by racing onto the next thing, but by paying attention and ending suffering.','Ajahn Amaro','true','true','photo.png');

INSERT INTO "teachers" VALUES(174,'','My greatest joy is giving the gift of love and hope through the dharma, knowing it is possible for humans to transform their hearts.  These dharma gifts include paying attention, practicing clarity and kindness and addressing the suffering of the world--which, of course, includes ourselves.

Right now I''m most enthusiastic about the first gift, paying attention, because it makes every part of our lives better.  Paying attention allows us to become more clear,  and each moment of clarity is a gift to ourselves and those around us.  Clarity keeps us from contributing to more suffering.  The gift of clarity and kindness also supports a peaceful heart, which allows us to address the suffering in the world with love.  When we practice clarity, we offer the possibility for humans to live in a different way.  But a peaceful heart is only the beginning.  We also have to take action,  go out and directly address the suffering with peace in our hearts.

As a parent, grandparent and a psychotherapist, I teach out of the stories of my life and the lives of those around me.  I am especially touched by personal narrative, accounts of spiritual journeys, and how these become vehicles for connecting with the dharma.  I believe in revealing my own story so that others are more at ease to reveal theirs.  Truth talking is a way out of suffering.  Discovering how our hearts and minds work and creating a dialogue supports right speech practice.  This is an on-going primary practice that we can do all the time.  My hope is that I encourage people how to pay attention and to tell the truth by example.
